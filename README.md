# Sales_Predection_usingML
The main objective of this project work is to find out the reliable sales trend prediction which is implemented by using data mining and ML techniques to get an insight on how a company should manage cash flow and resources. 
The prime idea is to envisage the pattern of sales and the quantities of the products to be sold based on some key features gathered from the raw data we have.
Analysis would help the business organizations to make a probabilistic decision at each important stage of marketing strategy.
